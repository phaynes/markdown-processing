# Automating the Preparation of Research Papers
## TLDR
Through an integrated set of automation technologies for the preparation of research papers, this site aims to reduces paper preparation time by 25-50%, while also supporting the creation of publication grade documents.  Technologies to achieve this include:
1. Submission ready PDF generation that includes full APAv7 referencing & style from markdown text.
2. Highly customisable proof, review, and commenting on documents using multiple AI's either directly within an IDE (Zed), from command line, or as part of a CI/CD process. Larger changes are controled through git.
3. Manage collected reference using an AI summarisation, and search.
4. Securely collaborate in real time with other team members using Zed, and mesh networking.
5. APAv7 styled markdown document viewers.

Data is managed using either public or private git repositories.

## Introduction
Preparation of high-quality research papers is complex, but the nature of this complexity is of two kinds, being the:
1. **Inherent difficulty** of subject being studied, key ideas, its nuances, and issues; and
2. **Accidental difficulty** surrounding the size of a literature, understanding overall issues of the field, to then allow synthesis so research questions may be practically answered, then preparing a paper to a high written standard, with completely accurate referencing against required academic standards such as APAv7, and doing so in a timely way. For those coming from technical field, this is often particularly difficult.

By taking advantage of emerging technologies, this site aims to foster the development and distribution of automated methods to prepare research papers, without the accidental complexity typically associated with research paper preparation. In this way researchers are freed to spend the time available for a given topic actually on the subject of interest, or alternatively presenting insights gathered with the greatest level of clarity possible, without the time drain typically associated with preparing publication grade materials.

In stating the above, the topic of preparing is itself a new field where the author also has plenty to learn - so feed back

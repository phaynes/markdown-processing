# Automating the Preparation of Student Academic Essays

** Welcome **
Imagine arriving at your class, ready to dive into the semester, only to find out your assignments require extensive research and perfect ‘APA 7 referencing’. What’s your first thought?

A quick look at the required reading and a few frantic Google searches later, you discover that mastering APA 7 seems like a pricey and tedious endeavour. Initial attempts at formatting, alongside the collective groans of your peers, make it clear: this feels more like student torture than a learning exercise. It’s a requirement that distracts from the actual goal of learning and skill development.

Despite this, traditional essay preparation remains a gatekeeper to the academic community. If you relish the idea of detailed, manual editing, this site might not be for you.

# Hand Crafted Approach to Essay Preparation

The traditional approach to essay preparation presents numerous challenges that can impede a student's learning experience and overall academic performance. Key issues include:

1. **Continuous Modification**: The final product is often modified up until submission, making automation impossible. Links between different elements, such as in-text references and bibliography entries, must be manually verified for correctness, adding to the workload.

2. **Time-Consuming Process**: Manual editing of essays is incredibly time-consuming. Students must repeatedly review their work to ensure all elements are correctly formatted and referenced, which detracts from the time they could spend on learning and understanding the content.

3. **Human Error**: The likelihood of human error is significant. Students can easily overlook minor mistakes, such as misplaced commas in citations, incorrect page numbers, or slight deviations from the required formatting style. These errors can accumulate and negatively impact the final grade.

4. **Consistency Issues**: Maintaining consistency throughout a lengthy document can be challenging. Inconsistent font sizes, heading styles, or reference formats can creep in, especially if multiple versions of the document are created over time.

5. **Learning Curve**: Understanding and applying the intricate rules of referencing styles like APA 7 requires a steep learning curve. Students must invest considerable effort in learning these guidelines, which might not be directly related to their field of study.

6. **Software Limitations**: While tools like Word templates, EndNote, and Mendeley exist to assist with formatting and referencing, they often have limitations. Templates might not cover all nuances of a specific style, and reference management tools may not fully integrate with the document's text, leading to discrepancies. Students often find that templates purporting to support APA 7 fall short, requiring manual interpretation of standards. Errors introduced during editing might go undetected until submission.

7. **Stress and Anxiety**: The pressure to ensure all references and formatting are perfect can cause significant stress and anxiety. This added pressure can detract from the overall learning experience and reduce the quality of the student's work.

8. **Repetition and Redundancy**: Each new assignment often requires re-entering references and re-formatting the document, leading to redundant work. This repetition can be frustrating and demotivating for students. Typically, the second assignment becomes a copy and edit of the previous one.

9. **Lack of Skill Development**: Focusing heavily on manual editing and formatting can divert attention from developing critical thinking and writing skills. The primary purpose of assignments—to enhance understanding and articulation of the subject matter—can be overshadowed by formatting concerns.

10. **Reference Management Challenges**: Reference management is known to be a significant challenge. Universities often provide tools like EndNote or Mendeley through the library, which, while helpful with formatting, only partially support full integrity between how a source is quoted in the text and its appearance in the reference list.

By addressing these challenges through automation, students can focus more on the content and learning objectives of their assignments, leading to a more meaningful and productive educational experience.

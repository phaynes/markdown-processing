# Automating the Preparation of Publication Research Papers

## TLDR

This project aims to reduce the preparation time of publication-grade, high-distinction-level research papers by 25-50% through an integrated set of automation technologies. The technologies developed for this purpose include:

1. Submission generation from markdown text that includes full APAv7 referencing and style requirements.
2. Highly customisable proofing, reviewing, and commenting on documents using multiple AIs, either directly within an IDE (Zed), from the command line, or as part of a CI/CD process. Larger changes are controlled through git.
3. Managing collected references using AI summarisation and search.
4. Securely collaborating in real-time with other team members using Zed and mesh networking.
5. APAv7 styled markdown document viewers.

Data is managed using either public or private git repositories.

## Introduction

The preparation of high-quality research papers is complex, involving two kinds of difficulty:

1. **Inherent difficulty:** The subject being studied, including its key ideas, nuances, and issues.
2. **Accidental difficulty:** The extensive literature, understanding the overall issues in the field, synthesising information to answer research questions, preparing a paper to high standards, ensuring completely accurate referencing according to academic standards like APAv7, and doing this in a timely manner. This process is often particularly challenging for individuals from technical fields.

By leveraging emerging technologies, this site aims to foster the development and distribution of automated methods for preparing research papers, thus alleviating the accidental complexities typically associated with this process. Researchers can then focus their available time on the subject of interest or present insights with the greatest clarity, without the time drain usually associated with preparing publication-grade materials.

Acknowledging that the topic of preparation itself is a new field, the author welcomes feedback.

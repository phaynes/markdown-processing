This paper examines teacher beliefs and practices regarding the inclusion of learners diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It aligns with @koutsoklenis2023 perspective that ADHD is a cognitive difference rather than a medical disorder. The paper assumes that accommodating learners with ADHD is part of normal teaching practice.

# ADHD: How it Manifests

ADHD is often characterised in the classroom by problematic behaviour, poor school performance, inability to sit still, impatience, answering questions without raising hands, and daydreaming. Persistent patterns of inattention, disorganisation, and hyperactivity-impulsivity are typical [@AmericanPsychiatricAssociation2022]. ADHD significantly impacts academic performance due to difficulties in sustaining attention and completing tasks. Social interactions may also suffer, leading to issues in forming and maintaining relationships [@barkley2014]. ADHD symptoms vary across age groups as children’s brains develop [@biederman2000age].

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [-@CDC2024], approximately 11.5% of U.S. children aged 3-17 have been diagnosed with ADHD. ADHD occurs in approximately 6–10% of Australian children and adolescents and 2–6% of adults [@graetz2001validity; @sawyer2018adequacy]. This high prevalence of ADHD challenges the notion that it is a disorder and suggests that it is a normal variation within the population.

The NSW Department of Education [-@nsw_education_2021] provides evidence-based strategies for ADHD. Many other resources are available, for example, the United States, not-for-profit, Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), offers practical approaches to recognising ADHD in the classroom and various strategies for managing it [@chadd2023].

# Strengths, Learning Needs, and Issues of Concern

Understanding the strengths and learning needs of students with ADHD requires a multifaceted approach that incorporates neurobiological, cognitive, and educational perspectives. ADHD, characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, impacts students' learning experiences and outcomes [@faraone2019sleep].

## Strengths of Students with ADHD

**Creativity and Innovation:** Students with ADHD often demonstrate high levels of creativity and the ability to think outside the box. They can generate imaginative ideas and solutions to problems, which can be harnessed in a learning environment that values innovation [@white2011creative].

**Hyper-focus:** Although ADHD is associated with inattention, students can also experience periods of hyper-focus on tasks that interest them. This can be advantageous in subjects they find engaging, allowing them to achieve deep concentration and productivity [@Ashinoff2021].

**Adaptability and Resilience:** Many students with ADHD develop strong adaptability and resilience due to their need to navigate a world that often does not accommodate their differences. These traits can be strengths in dynamic and changing environments [@deSchipper2015].

# Text to Proof

The mission of this site is to provide end-to-end automation for academic essay preparation, allowing students to focus on understanding and engaging with their subjects, and delivering high-quality essays without the highly stressful last-minute scramble.

If you are an academic reading this, fear not; there is something for you too. Perhaps trudging through and marking endless numbers of papers for formatting, language, and stylistic errors is not for you. If so, this site aims to raise the academic bar for your students so they all submit papers that look as though they were written by a professor.

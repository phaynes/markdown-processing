It is a truism that in much of software the only documentation that can be trusted is the code. Yet within the software development environment, few tools exist to support development of publication grade documentation. The result: the documentation written by software engineers is more "techlish"  than high quality english.
Furthermore, where publication grade documentation is produced, it is done using standard office tooling, in separate environments that quickly obsoletes and can become disconnected from the overall system development effort.


Renewables cannot power an industrial country like Australia; this is simply a matter of physics and environmental modelling. All credible economic studies demonstrate that nuclear energy is significantly cheaper than renewables, as measured by the price to the consumers. Nuclear runs 24/7 essential to ensuring industry and critical infrastructure such as hospital run. While the Malthusian notion that Australia's CO2 emmisions are material to global climate change is preposterous, if you believe there is actually a climate crisis - then all options must be on the table. Advocating against nuclear power is complete hypocrocy - and on any grounds should be ashamed of yourself as unAustralian.
